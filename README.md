# CSC148 Docstring Generator
A docstring template generator that adds docstring template to classes
    and functions in your filesÂ and insert missing elements into existing ones.

# How to use:
- Write all your code first before running this.
- Place this file inside the folder you want to process.
- Run this file (for example, right click in PyCharm and select 'Run').
    Your files are now processed and backup is made.
- Open your files, press "ctrl + F"(Windows) or "command + F"(Mac) to
    bring up the search bar. Write "[TODO]"(without the quotation marks)
    and press "Enter" once. Press "Esc", then hit "F3" to search for the next
    "[TODO]", write appropriate text then hit "F3" again and repeat until all
    "[TODO]"s are gone.
- Add attributes to class docstrings (if some were missing) and remove
    unnecessary ones (such as inherited attributes in super constructor).
    You may also add descriptions to each property / attribute by yourself.

# What will happen:
- All python files under the same folder as well as files in the sub-folders
    will be processed.
- In each file, a docstring will be added for every function and class, as
    well as one for the entire document.
    - function: A type contract will be added for every parameter. Doctest
        will be added.
    - class: The generator will scan the constructor (if exists) for any
        self.xxxx or self._xxxx properties.
        Warning: This feature will NOT consider inheritance.
- Newly added docstring will have "[TODO]" as placeholder for the user to
    enter data, such as representation invariants.
- If a docstring already exists, descriptions and doctests will be inserted.
- The original version will be renamed to "[old file name].bak" under the
    same folder. Check the new versions before running the generator again,
    or else the old backup will be overwritten.

# Example:
Before:
```python
def my_function(param1, param2):
    return param1 + param2

class my_class:
    def __init__(self, param1):
        self.attr1 = param1
        self.attr2 = 0
        self._pattr1 = 0
        self._pattr2 = 0

    def my_method(self, param1, param2):
        print(param1, param2)

    def my_method2(self, param1, param2):
        """
        for existing docstrings, parameter descriptions and doctests will be
        inserted.

        @type self: my_class
        @type param1: int
        @type param2: int
            existing descriptions will not be modified.
        """
        return 0
```
After:
```python
"""
[TODO]
"""

def my_function(param1, param2):
    """[TODO]
    
    Preconditions: [TODO]
    
    @type param1: [TODO]

    @rtype: [TODO]
    
    >>> [TODO]
    
    """
    return param1 + param2

class my_class:
    """[TODO]

            [TODO]
        @type param2: [TODO]
            [TODO]
        @rtype: None
        
        >>> [TODO]

        >>> [TODO]
        
        """
        return 0
```

# Change log:
- Able to insert descriptions and doctests into existing docstrings
- Doctests are now considered
- Provide an example of before and after. Covering document docstring,
    function, class (private + public), and unchanged existing docstrings.
- Minor style changes
- Default return type to None if no "return" statement is present in a function.
    An exception is when the function raises NotImplementedError, or pass.
- Adds description placeholder for every parameter and attribute except self.
- Initial release

# Road-map:
- Able to insert more missing elements into existing docstrings.
- Automatically detect the type of some variables
